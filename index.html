        <p>Hello -- you have landed on my portfolio -- welcome! My name is Sharon Prochazkza and even though I am sometimes mistaken as the grandmother of my two kids (it might be because of all the premature grey?!) -- I am indeed their devoted mother. I live in Chapel Hill, NC (more on the Carrboro side of town) with my husband, two kids and senior dog, Rizoe (nearing 16!). Prior to kids and settling down in NC, my husband and I have lived in many states together, in order -- VT, NC, OR, MA, and NY. Somehow I have managed to work for a handful of fortune 500 companies, including Enron, Intel, and GE. I gave up technology to pursue a Masters of Science in Environmental Toxicology and Geographical Information Systems (or GIS mapping). After grad school and staying home to raise our kids, I had the opportunity to map and prepare an environmental dataset of epic porportions, as my former professor was called on as an expert witness in the BP Deepwater Horizon trial. One opportunity leads to another and I found my niche with a local UNC non-profit startup called Counter Tools. I consider myself extrememly fortunate, having once driven 200 mi/day (100 mi each way - no JOKE!), I now commute by bike all of 2.1 mi unless the weather is horrible.</p>
